                The Azores is known for its unique blend of European and Latin American culture. The islands were first settled by Portuguese explorers in the 15th century, and the influence of Portuguese culture is still evident in the local architecture, cuisine, and language.

                Another popular island is Terceira, which is known for its historic city of Angra do Heroísmo. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is home to a beautiful old town and a historic fort, and it offers a glimpse into the island's rich history. In addition to its historical attractions, Terceira is also a popular destination for golfers, with several world-class golf courses located on the island.
